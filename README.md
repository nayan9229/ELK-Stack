# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker
ELK Stack Docker Playground 

Run the latest version of the [Elastic stack][elk-stack] with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.

> :information_source: The Docker images backing this stack include [Stack Features][stack-features] (formerly X-Pack)
with [paid features][paid-features] enabled by default (see [How to disable paid
features](#how-to-disable-paid-features) to disable them). The [trial license][trial-license] is valid for 30 days.

Based on the official Docker images from Elastic:

* [elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker)
* [logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docker)
* [kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana-docker)

## Usage

### Bringing up the stack

Start the stack using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

You can also run all services in the background (detached mode) by adding the `-d` flag to the above command.

> :information_source: You must run `docker-compose build` first whenever you switch branch or update a base image.

If you are starting the stack for the very first time, please read the section below attentively.
